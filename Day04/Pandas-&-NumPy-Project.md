# Python for Data Analysis: Pandas & NumPy Project

## 📅 Timeline
- **Day 78 – Day 82 of Learning Journey**
- Explored and practiced **NumPy** and **Pandas** concepts step by step.
- Applied learning to hands-on quizzes and coding challenges.
- Completed **Python for Data Analysis: Pandas & NumPy** project.
- Earned the **certificate of completion** ✅

## 📘 Key Learnings
### 🔹 NumPy
- Creating arrays and performing slicing/indexing.
- Generating random numbers using `np.random.randint()`.
- Accessing elements efficiently (e.g., `grocery_list[-1]`).
- Understanding array operations and broadcasting.

### 🔹 Pandas
- Creating and manipulating **DataFrames**.
- Accessing column names (`df.columns`).
- Viewing subsets of data (`df.head()`, `df.tail()`).
- Applying functions to columns (`.apply()` with custom functions).
- Performing updates and transformations on data.

## ✅ Completed Quizzes & Exercises
- Identified correct indexing methods in NumPy arrays.
- Practiced generating random integers within a range.
- Differentiated between `df.columns` vs `df.columns()`.
- Displayed specific rows with `df.tail()`.
- Fixed function application errors with `.apply()` in Pandas.

## 🎯 Achievements
- Gained strong understanding of **data wrangling** with Pandas.
- Learned **efficient numerical operations** with NumPy.
- Improved **problem-solving skills** through debugging.
- Successfully finished the **Pandas & NumPy project**.
- Received the **certificate** of accomplishment 🏆

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Explore **data visualization** with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Work on **real-world datasets** for deeper practice.
- Continue building portfolio-ready projects.



## 🙌 Reflection
This project was an important step in my **invincibility plan** 🔥. It strengthened my confidence in handling datasets, applying transformations, and preparing for advanced projects in **data analysis and AI**.

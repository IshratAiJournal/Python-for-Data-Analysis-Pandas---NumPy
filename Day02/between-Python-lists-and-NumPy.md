# ðŸš€ Day 02 Progress â€“ Python for Data Analysis (Pandas & NumPy)

## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned Today
- Understood the **differences between Python lists and NumPy arrays**.
- Practiced **indexing and slicing** in NumPy.
- Learned how to:
  - Access single elements (`grocery_list[-1]`)
  - Slice ranges (`arr[2:5]`)
  - Use negative indexing.

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- **NumPy arrays** are faster and more memory-efficient compared to lists.
- Indexing works similar to lists, but arrays allow powerful vectorized operations.

## ðŸ”¥ My Progress
- Solved multiple-choice questions on **NumPy indexing**.
- Built confidence with **array manipulation**.
